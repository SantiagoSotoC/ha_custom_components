# AlarmDecoder Custom Integration for Home Assistant

This is a custom component for integrating AlarmDecoder with Home Assistant, allowing support for multiple alarm panels (keypads) based on their address.

üõ†Ô∏è This is a **modified version** of the official Home Assistant AlarmDecoder integration that now uses **YAML configuration** instead of UI configuration.

---

## Installation and Configuration

### YAML Configuration

This integration is now configured via YAML in your `configuration.yaml` file. Add the following configuration:

```yaml
custom_alarmdecoder:
  protocol: socket # or "serial"
  host: 192.168.1.100 # for socket protocol
  port: 10000 # for socket protocol
  # device_path: /dev/ttyUSB0  # for serial protocol
  # device_baudrate: 115200  # for serial protocol
  auto_bypass: false
  code_arm_required: true
  keypads: [0, 1] # List of keypad addresses
  zones:
    1:
      name: "Front Door"
      type: "door"
      bypassable: true
    2:
      name: "Back Door"
      type: "door"
      bypassable: true
    3:
      name: "Living Room Motion"
      type: "motion"
      bypassable: true
      rfid: 1
      loop: 1
    10:
      name: "Kitchen Window"
      type: "window"
      bypassable: false
```

### Configuration Options

#### Main Configuration

- **protocol**: `socket` or `serial`
- **host**: IP address (required for socket protocol)
- **port**: Port number (required for socket protocol)
- **device_path**: Serial device path (required for serial protocol)
- **device_baudrate**: Baud rate (optional for serial protocol, default: 115200)
- **auto_bypass**: Enable automatic bypass of faulted zones (default: false)
- **code_arm_required**: Require code for arming (default: true)
- **keypads**: List of keypad addresses (default: [0])

#### Zone Configuration

Each zone is defined by its number (1-999) and can have the following properties:

- **name**: Display name for the zone (required)
- **type**: Zone type (optional, default: "window")
  - Available types: `door`, `window`, `motion`, `smoke`, `glass`, `co`, `flood`, `gas`, `heat`, `medical`, `freeze`, `generic`
- **bypassable**: Whether the zone can be bypassed (optional, default: false)
- **rfid**: RFID address (optional)
- **loop**: Loop number (optional)

### Basic Setup

After adding the YAML configuration:

1. Restart Home Assistant
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Devices & Services**
3. Click **Add Integration**
4. Search for **AlarmDecoder**
5. Follow the setup wizard to configure basic connection settings

The zones and advanced settings will be read from your YAML configuration.

## Status

‚úÖ **Functional** ‚Äì This integration is currently **working** with YAML configuration.

### Current Limitations

- **Single partition support only**: Currently supports one partition (default partition)
- **Default partition messages**: All alarm messages are sent from the default partition address

### Compatibility

‚ö†Ô∏è **Honeywell Panels Only** ‚Äì This version has been **tested only with Honeywell panels** and specifically with a **Honeywell Vista 48LA** panel. DSC panel compatibility has not been tested and may not work correctly.

**Tested Hardware:**

- ‚úÖ **Honeywell Vista 48LA** (Fully tested and working)
- ‚ùì **DSC Panels** (Not tested - compatibility unknown)

---

## Current Features

### ‚úÖ Zone Bypass System

- **Individual bypass switches**: Each configurable zone has its own Home Assistant switch entity
- **Manual bypass control**: Toggle bypass status for individual zones from the UI
- **Automatic bypass commands**: System sends proper bypass commands when arming
- **Auto-bypass support**: Automatic bypass of zones with faults during arming
- **Bypass command format**: `code + 6 + zones + *` for manual bypass, `code + 6 + #` for auto-bypass

### ‚úÖ Alarm Control

- **Arm Away/Home**: Full support with bypass integration
- **Disarm**: Standard disarm functionality
- **Custom keypresses**: Send custom commands to the alarm panel
- **Toggle chime**: Control panel chime settings

### ‚úÖ Configuration

- **Zone configuration**: Add, edit, and remove zones through the UI
- **Bypass settings**: Configure which zones support bypass
- **Zone types**: Support for different zone types (door/window, motion, etc.)
- **Multi-language support**: Full Spanish and English translations

### ‚úÖ Zone Management

- **Zone numbering**: Supports zones 1-999 without leading zeros
- **Zone deletion**: Proper zone removal handling
- **Zone editing**: Edit existing zone configurations

---

## Hardware Requirements

### Supported Panels

- **Honeywell Vista Series**: ‚úÖ Tested and working
  - **Vista 48LA**: ‚úÖ Fully tested
  - **Other Vista models**: Likely compatible but not specifically tested

### Unsupported/Untested Panels

- **DSC Panels**: ‚ùì Not tested - may require command format modifications
- **Other manufacturers**: ‚ùì Unknown compatibility

### AlarmDecoder Hardware

- Any AlarmDecoder device (AD2USB, AD2Serial, AD2PI, etc.)
- Connected to a compatible Honeywell panel

---

## Planned Features (Future Releases)

- **Multi-partition support**: Support for multiple alarm partitions
- **Partition-specific messages**: Messages routed to specific partition addresses
- **Advanced keypad handling**: Full multi-keypad address support
- **DSC panel support**: Testing and compatibility for DSC panels

---

## Configuration

### Basic Setup

1. Go to Settings > Devices & Services
2. Click "Add Integration" and search for "AlarmDecoder"
3. Configure your AlarmDecoder connection details
4. Set up zones and their bypass capabilities

### Zone Bypass Configuration

1. In the integration options, select "Configure Zones"
2. For each zone:
   - Enter zone name and type
   - Enable "Allow Bypass" for zones you want to control
   - Configure zone-specific settings (RFID loop, relay settings, etc.)

### Usage Examples

#### Manual Zone Bypass

```yaml
# Example: Bypass zone 1 and 5, then arm away
service: switch.turn_on
target:
  entity_id:
    - switch.zone_1_bypass
    - switch.zone_5_bypass

# Then arm the system - bypasses will be applied automatically
service: alarm_control_panel.alarm_arm_away
target:
  entity_id: alarm_control_panel.alarmdecoder
data:
  code: "1234"
```

#### Auto-Bypass

Enable "Auto-bypass on arm" in the integration options to automatically bypass zones with faults when arming.

## Command Reference

### Bypass Commands (Honeywell Format)

- **Manual bypass**: `code + 6 + zones + *` (e.g., `123461520*` for zones 1, 5, 20)
- **Auto bypass**: `code + 6 + #` (e.g., `12346#` for automatic fault bypass)

### Arm Commands (Honeywell Format)

- **Arm Away**: `code + 2` (e.g., `12342`)
- **Arm Home**: `code + 3` (e.g., `12343`)
- **Disarm**: `code + 1` (e.g., `12341`)

**Note**: These command formats are specific to Honeywell panels. DSC panels may use different command sequences.

## Troubleshooting

### Panel Compatibility Issues

If you're using a DSC panel and commands aren't working:

1. Check your panel's manual for the correct bypass command format
2. Consider contributing DSC support by testing and reporting command formats

### Zone Deletion Issues

If you cannot delete a zone (e.g., zone 9 vs 09 formatting):

1. Try entering the zone number without leading zeros
2. Clear the zone name field completely to delete the zone

### RFID Loop Configuration

If you encounter type errors when editing zones with RFID loops:

1. Clear the RFID loop field
2. Re-enter the value
3. Save the configuration
