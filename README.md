# AlarmDecoder Custom Integration for Home Assistant

This is a custom component for integrating AlarmDecoder with Home Assistant, allowing support for multiple alarm panels (keypads) based on their address.

üõ†Ô∏è This is a **modified version** of the official Home Assistant AlarmDecoder integration, intended to support additional features such as multi-keypad handling and automatic zone bypass.

---

## Status

‚úÖ **Functional** ‚Äì This integration is currently **working** with basic features implemented.

### Current Limitations
- **Single partition support only**: Currently supports one partition (default partition)
- **Default partition messages**: All alarm messages are sent from the default partition address

### Compatibility
‚ö†Ô∏è **Honeywell Panels Only** ‚Äì This version has been **tested only with Honeywell panels** and specifically with a **Honeywell Vista 48LA** panel. DSC panel compatibility has not been tested and may not work correctly.

**Tested Hardware:**
- ‚úÖ **Honeywell Vista 48LA** (Fully tested and working)
- ‚ùì **DSC Panels** (Not tested - compatibility unknown)

---

## Current Features

### ‚úÖ Sub-Device Organization
- **Improved device structure**: Organized device hierarchy for better UI experience
- **Main device**: AlarmDecoder Panel contains panel-level entities (Panel Display, Alarm Panel)
- **Zone sub-devices**: Each zone creates its own sub-device for better organization
- **Grouped entities**: Zone status (binary sensor) and bypass control (switch) are grouped under each zone device
- **Clean naming**: Simplified entity names since context is provided by the device structure

### ‚úÖ Zone Bypass System
- **Individual bypass switches**: Each configurable zone has its own Home Assistant switch entity
- **Manual bypass control**: Toggle bypass status for individual zones from the UI
- **Automatic bypass commands**: System sends proper bypass commands when arming
- **Auto-bypass support**: Automatic bypass of zones with faults during arming
- **Bypass command format**: `code + 6 + zones + *` for manual bypass, `code + 6 + #` for auto-bypass

### ‚úÖ Alarm Control
- **Arm Away/Home**: Full support with bypass integration
- **Disarm**: Standard disarm functionality
- **Custom keypresses**: Send custom commands to the alarm panel
- **Toggle chime**: Control panel chime settings

### ‚úÖ Configuration
- **Zone configuration**: Add, edit, and remove zones through the UI
- **Bypass settings**: Configure which zones support bypass
- **Zone types**: Support for different zone types (door/window, motion, etc.)
- **Multi-language support**: Full Spanish and English translations

### ‚úÖ Zone Management
- **Zone numbering**: Supports zones 1-999 without leading zeros
- **Zone deletion**: Proper zone removal handling
- **Zone editing**: Edit existing zone configurations

---

## Hardware Requirements

### Supported Panels
- **Honeywell Vista Series**: ‚úÖ Tested and working
  - **Vista 48LA**: ‚úÖ Fully tested
  - **Other Vista models**: Likely compatible but not specifically tested

### Unsupported/Untested Panels
- **DSC Panels**: ‚ùì Not tested - may require command format modifications
- **Other manufacturers**: ‚ùì Unknown compatibility

### AlarmDecoder Hardware
- Any AlarmDecoder device (AD2USB, AD2Serial, AD2PI, etc.)
- Connected to a compatible Honeywell panel

---

## Planned Features (Future Releases)

- **Multi-partition support**: Support for multiple alarm partitions
- **Partition-specific messages**: Messages routed to specific partition addresses
- **Advanced keypad handling**: Full multi-keypad address support
- **DSC panel support**: Testing and compatibility for DSC panels

---

## Device Structure

The integration creates a well-organized device hierarchy:

### Main Device: "AlarmDecoder Panel"
Contains panel-level entities:
- **Panel Display** (sensor) - Shows the current panel display text
- **Alarm Panel** (alarm control panel) - Main alarm control interface

### Zone Sub-Devices: "Zone X - [Zone Name]"
Each configured zone creates its own sub-device containing:
- **Status** (binary sensor) - Zone status (open/closed, fault/normal)
- **Bypass** (switch) - Bypass control for the zone

**Benefits:**
- **Better organization**: Related entities are grouped together
- **Cleaner UI**: Each zone appears as a separate device card in Home Assistant
- **Easier management**: Users can manage zones individually
- **Scalable**: Easy to add more entities per zone in the future

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)
1. Add this repository to HACS as a custom repository
2. Install "AlarmDecoder Custom" through HACS
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Add the integration via Settings > Devices & Services

### Manual Installation
1. Copy the `custom_components/custom_alarmdecoder` folder to your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Add the integration via Settings > Devices & Services

---

## Configuration

### Basic Setup
1. Go to Settings > Devices & Services
2. Click "Add Integration" and search for "AlarmDecoder"
3. Configure your AlarmDecoder connection details
4. Set up zones and their bypass capabilities

### Zone Bypass Configuration
1. In the integration options, select "Configure Zones"
2. For each zone:
   - Enter zone name and type
   - Enable "Allow Bypass" for zones you want to control
   - Configure zone-specific settings (RFID loop, relay settings, etc.)

### Usage Examples

#### Manual Zone Bypass
```yaml
# Example: Bypass zone 1 and 5, then arm away
service: switch.turn_on
target:
  entity_id: 
    - switch.zone_1_front_door_bypass  # Note: actual entity names depend on your zone configuration
    - switch.zone_5_kitchen_window_bypass

# Then arm the system - bypasses will be applied automatically
service: alarm_control_panel.alarm_arm_away
target:
  entity_id: alarm_control_panel.alarmdecoder_panel_alarm_panel
data:
  code: "1234"
```

#### Auto-Bypass
Enable "Auto-bypass on arm" in the integration options to automatically bypass zones with faults when arming.

---

## Command Reference

### Bypass Commands (Honeywell Format)
- **Manual bypass**: `code + 6 + zones + *` (e.g., `123461520*` for zones 1, 5, 20)
- **Auto bypass**: `code + 6 + #` (e.g., `12346#` for automatic fault bypass)

### Arm Commands (Honeywell Format)
- **Arm Away**: `code + 2` (e.g., `12342`)
- **Arm Home**: `code + 3` (e.g., `12343`)
- **Disarm**: `code + 1` (e.g., `12341`)

**Note**: These command formats are specific to Honeywell panels. DSC panels may use different command sequences.

## Troubleshooting

### Panel Compatibility Issues
If you're using a DSC panel and commands aren't working:
1. Check your panel's manual for the correct bypass command format
2. Consider contributing DSC support by testing and reporting command formats

### Zone Deletion Issues
If you cannot delete a zone (e.g., zone 9 vs 09 formatting):
1. Try entering the zone number without leading zeros
2. Clear the zone name field completely to delete the zone

### RFID Loop Configuration
If you encounter type errors when editing zones with RFID loops:
1. Clear the RFID loop field
2. Re-enter the value
3. Save the configuration
